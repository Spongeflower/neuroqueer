<h1>Chinese</h1>
<p>
  Chinese is considered one language by the Chinese due to emphasis on cultural unity, but it is considered a family of languages by the West since its varieties are generally not mutually intelligible. (Meaning, within a branch like Mandarin, dialects may be mutually intelligible, but between a variety of Mandarin and a variety of Yue, there is generally no mutual intelligibility. However, within some branches, even geographically adjacent varieties may present intelligibility challenges up to the point of mutual unintelligibility.) The official language of China is Standard Chinese, which is a modified version of the Beijing dialect of Mandarin. Since the differentiation of the dialects, Mandarin has been the most spoken mother tongue and covers the greatest land area, associated with the north of China, where land is flatter such that people can move more freely across large areas, spreading the language. In the south of China, the land is hillier and more mountainous and as such, long-distance travel was harder, so local varieties mostly stayed in place and evolved independently, becoming very different than other varieties, even geographically close ones. The de facto official language of Taiwan is also Mandarin, also based on the Beijing dialect, but there are minor differences between the Taiwanese and the Mainland standards.

<p>Historically, Old Chinese was the ancestral language of all Chinese. This language did not have tones. The Min branch split off from Old Chinese, whereas the rest of Old Chinese evolved into Later Han Chinese, spoken in the 1st to 3rd centuries CE, reprensenting an intermediate stage between Old Chinese and Middle Chinese, which had tones and from which all non-Min dialects eventually diverged. Classical Chinese is a <i>written</i> variety of Chinese that originated in the Old Chinese period but which continued to be used widely until modern times in literary contexts. Individual literate speakers could pronounce Classical Chinese texts using their contemporaneous local dialects, and among the government the chosen dialect of the administration, but the language itself is a written one, largely comparable in nature to the written standards of Norwegian, Bokmål and Nynorsk.</p>
