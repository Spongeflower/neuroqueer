<h1>Chinese Poetry</h1>

<p>
In traditional Chinese poetry there is typically a tightly regulated form that every poem is written in, encompassing a rhythmic scheme that sets the number of characters per phrase, and the total length of the poem, as well as a rhyme scheme that considers tones. The Tang Dynasty (618 to 907 CE) is considered the golden era of Chinese poetry. Chinese children are made by their parents and teachers to memorize many Tang poems. Having grown up in the United States, my parents and teachers at Chinese school also made me memorize Tang poems and a few Song <i>cí</i> (詞), which are lyric poems from the succeeding Song Dynasty (960 to 1279 CE). (I also had to memorize some fragments from the Analects of Confucius.) The characteric lyric poems from the Song Dynasty each follow one of about 800 schemes of rhythm and rhyme, called <i>cípái</i> (詞牌), which come from specific musical tunes. Typically, Tang poetry has lines of equal length, while Song poetry has lines of unequal length, though this is a broad generalization. Another important source in the Chinese poetic canon is the <i>Book of Songs</i>, a.k.a. <i>Classic of Poetry</i> (《詩經》), a collection of 305 poems from the 11th to 7th centuries BCE. These poems have many rare characters and grammatical structures and are harder to understand for the typical literate Chinese person than the Tang and Song poems. They typically have lines of 4 characters, though this is also a generalization.

Translating Chinese poetry is a difficult task because the meaning, elegance, rhythm, and rhyme cannot be simultaneously preserved. Thus, sacrifices are required. Since Chinese characters are each pronounced with a single syllable and each represent a unit of meaning, I came up with one approach several years ago during undergrad that translates every character into one word in English, ideally a monosyllabic word. This preserves the literal meaning and the rhythm as closely as possible, though in English this process often produces a poem of a rather crude quality, usually grammatically incomplete or awkward. Later, while traveling across the United States, I practiced translating with a new approach, which was to preserve the elegance and rhyme of Chinese poems by taking relatively small liberties in choosing translations of words, but in a way that would allow the English lines to have a palpable rhythm and rhyme, though not necessarily following the same schemes as the Chinese source. Later, during a brief period in which I read poetry weekly at the Gypsy Café in Tulsa, Oklahoma, I began to present each poem translated in both of these ways, telling the audience that the real essence of the poem could be felt by interpolating between the vibes of the two translations. I will present several poems below thusly, with dual translations.

Another thing to note is that Standard Chinese readings of old poems do not accurately present the poem as it would have sounded with older phonology. In Tang and Song poetry, the original phonology came from Middle Chinese, the last common ancestor of virtually all non-Min Chinese dialect groups, i.e. Mandarin (including Standard Chinese a.k.a. Putonghua), Wu, Hui, Gan, Hakka, Xiang, and Yue (including Cantonese). Min is the dialect group that originates from what is now the province of Fujian, across the strait from Taiwan, and is believed to have descended directly from Old Chinese (the language of the <i>Book of Songs</i>) in parallel with Middle Chinese. In Middle Chinese, there are some sounds that are difficult for modern Chinese speakers to pronounce, so using pure Middle Chinese phonology would feel awkward and even foreign to both reciters and listeners. Hence, I promote the usage of a variety of Chinese I began to develop, a Chinese "koine" of sorts that starts from Late Middle Chinese phonology and applies some common sound changes that some modern varieties of Chinese have undergone, including rime mergers and tonal developments. The resulting phonological system should sound like an in-between dialect whose sound most Chinese speakers would not have a hard time getting accustomed to. It sounds modern enough, familiar to all Chinese ears, yet conservative enough in phonology to restore much of the acoustic àffect of an older reading. I will provide a recording of a koine reading for each poems I present below.
