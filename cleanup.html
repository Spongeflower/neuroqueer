<h1>Clean up our world!</h1>
<h2>July 23, 2025</h2>
<p>
There is a sidewalk in my neighborhood on a highway overpass. It is littered with trash. Let's call the city and see what they do. If they are not complete in their cleanup, we will go there ourselves and rid the trash from the sidewalk. Hopefully this will discourage people from further dumping. As litter already present invites more litter, perhaps the lack of litter invites cleanliness. Every minute wasted theorizing represents the potential of a creature eating the trash.

The problem is now reported to NYC 311 under the categories of illegal dumping and chronic littering. For the former complaint perhaps a crew will go there to clean up the mess. For the latter, a crew might sit there and issue fines to people who litter. I question the efficacy of the latter measure, as I believe the best deterrent to littering (aside from holding the principle of never littering) is a clean ground in the first place. We'll see what happens. I wish that every individual felt personally responsible for doing his part in the upkeep of the local neighborhood, and generally of the planet.
