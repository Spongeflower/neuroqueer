<h1>Clean up our world!</h1>
<h2>July 23, 2025</h2>
<p>
There is a sidewalk in my neighborhood on a highway overpass. It is littered with trash. Let's call the city and see what they do. If they are not complete in their cleanup, we will go there ourselves and rid the trash from the sidewalk. Hopefully this will discourage people from further dumping. As litter already present invites more litter, perhaps the lack of litter invites cleanliness. Every minute wasted theorizing represents the potential of a creature eating the trash.
</p>
  
<h2>July 24, 2025</h2>
<p>
The problem is now reported to 311 under the categories of illegal dumping and chronic littering. For the former complaint perhaps a crew will go there to clean up the mess. For the latter, a crew might sit there and issue fines to people who litter. I question the efficacy of the latter measure, as I believe the best deterrent to littering (aside from holding the principle of never littering) is a clean ground in the first place. We'll see what happens. I wish that every individual felt personally responsible for doing his part in the upkeep of the local neighborhood, and generally of the planet.
</p>

<h2>July 25, 2025</h2>
<p>
The city emailed me saying they closed the case I submitted, for there was already an open case targeting the same location. Is that so? If cleanup has already been done, it was not thorough enough. I will check back on the location when I pass by again.
</p>

<p>
In the meantime, I think about cleaning up in general. Earth comes to us as a gift. Why do we not treat her then with reverence by at least keeping her free of litter? Surely there are more profound ways to clean up the Earth, but we do what we most immediately are capable of, first.
</p>

<p>
What is the benefit of cleaning up? Consider yesterday that I was still rooming with ghosts of a past self. I had a whole box under my bed of papers issued to me by teachers and bosses during my time training for and then working for the local emergency medical service. This job, while nourishing in ways, damaged my health, so I quit months ago. However, I never let go of the scraps of paper issued to me. Some I wish to save for scrapbooking. These scraps hold sentimental value, but most of the pile was indeed junk, and I knew that when I was to move again I would have to drag the box to my new place, just for it to collect dust again.
</p>

<p>
Out of the blue, I took out the box yesterday afternoon and sorted through the scraps, verifying what I already knew, that these papers were a burden, both in physical weight and in spiritual restraint. No matter how subconscious the mechanism is, as long as I keep the vestiges of a past era with no present significance, my heartstrings remain tied to the worries and even trivial pleasantries of a life I have in theory chosen to leave for good reason.
</p>

<p>
Well, all these scraps are now gone! I immediately noticed that the box became lighter, and I slept.
</p>

<p>
This morning someone I had not spoken with in months asked me what I was up to. She was a traveler from Turkey that I was able to host in my house for 4 days immediately after I had quit my job. In fact I was only able to have the energy and time to host her because I had quit my job. So I told her that I threw away all my old scraps from work. She then asked me if I felt lighter, and I smiled, knowing that she gets it too. Absolutely, I felt lighter! Whereas yesterday the most noticeable effect was physical decluttering, today I feel the effects of the spiritual cleanse. Just as I could only host this traveler due to having freed up my time and energy, thereby opening my heart to new connection with all its joys and complexities, today I opened my heart to whatever lay ahead.
</p>

<p>
By the afternoon, the storm clouds had rolled in. I was in the kitchen sitting in the muggy air on a rolly chair by the window, eating rice with dried tofu and vegetables. I invited the storm in, and sure enough the storm blew in, puddling up on the floor and wetting my feet and dress. A housemate of mine came in and started singing in his powerful, soulful voice. As I squatted by the refrigerator to store my extra rice, I felt such contentment. What a beautiful day, I thought. At that moment I wished I could remember this scene forever.
</p>

<p>
Now the sun has set and my dress has dried. No longer, however, do I feel that same simple peace of the afternoon storm. I wrote to a close friend of mine:
</p>

<p>
"Somehow I am yearning ... no longer in the limerent frame but for something to incite my passion. It feels uneasy. Indeed, it is rewarding to listen to Arabic every day, to work on Cherokee verbs, and to listen to and read books. Yesterday I even threw out old scraps, and for that I feel more buoyant. I am thankful for the rolling along of my routines. Nonetheless I feel spiritually stirred away, to be sucked into adventure again. Perhaps my decluttering has set me naked in the face of renewed formal studies, the excitement for which distracts me from sinking into these summer evenings ...
</p>

<p>
"I am thankful every day, even to be able to already mourn my leaving within three weeks. But for now, my mind must still be here."
</p>

<p>
Indeed, I will soon pass on to yet another new era, and despite the beauty of now, I can't help but feel fidgety and wistful. Soon I will leave, and it seems fitting that the carnations gifted to me by a friend have withered and crispened, signifying the end of an era.
</p>

<p>
Now that I think of it, my routines in linguistic work, language learning, reading, and also exercise anchor me to the present. But now that my heartstrings are unhooked, I once again return to my nature of seeking connection.
</p>

<p>
In the past, this has caused me to fall in love with guests, or with new friends, but these days I feel more drawn to the adventure of my forthcoming studies in maritime school. In the margins of my time, I am exploring celestial navigation and Chinese naval history. I believe I am essentially right to resist the strong pull of overyearning by rooting myself in gratitude and existing habits. However, my point here is that now that I am even <i>able</i> to yearn again, I can be thankful for the new goodness this brings, even if the sweet is tempered by bitter.
</p>

<p>
Ah, Mother Earth! I yearn for your health. In this world we are plagued by excessive consumption and desire for infinite growth. Our capitalist economies have generated unfathomable waste, poisoning the planet. The situation can seem bleak, especially knowing that the cleanup work will take generations. However, we can still help by starting small. I hasten everyone to start by delittering your neighborhood. In cleaning up our streets, walkways, and gardens, we reduce the inflamation not only in the natural ecosystems around us, but also in the <a href="/spirit.html">oikology of spirit</a>.
</p>

<p>
Remember that we are <i>part</i> of Earth. Her condition is our condition. When we clean her up, we also clean ourselves up, and what benefit will cleaning up bring? Think about it ... only in liberating our home from the ghosts of the past can we welcome in a new era, rife with all the joys and complexities of change.
</p>

<p>
Anyway, my peeps ... if you live near me I'll invite you to help me clean up our neighborhood!

<h2>August 6, 2025</h2>
<p>
Yesterday I received an email from the Department of Sanitation, informing me that they closed my service request case. "The Department of Sanitation investigated this complaint and found no condition at the location," they wrote. I had previously thought they had closed both of my requests (one for illegal dumping and the other for littering), but this message proved they had only closed the littering case earlier, and only this time the illegal dumping case. Well, you know what that means! I finally also got the time to do a cleanup, so I immediately invited my neuroqueer group on Discord to join me today. I imagined that nobody would come, for there is no recognizable personal benefit to cleaning up my neighborhood, but I thought it would be good to invite everyone anyway.
</p>

<p>
This morning I rushed out of the house, excited to clean up. I had had 4 slices of watermelon for breakfast and I brought along 2 black trash bags and a bag of disposable gloves that I had saved up from my previous job in the ambulance service.
</p>

<p>
I got to the bridge and started at one corner. I put on some gloves. Immediately a garbage truck stopped at the intersection. I waved to the two men in the truck and then pointed at the trash. I guess my point was that I was trying to tell them that I was going to clean this up, but they must have taken it as an invitation to join me (which I appreciate), for one of the men simply shook his head at me. The light turned green and the truck drove off. Fine! Sanitation proven at least three times by now that they are unable to do the job, so this is precisely why I came. I squatted down and started grabbing trash by the handful, stuffing it in the first trash bag. Earlier in the morning I had told Dexter (subletter-cum-housemate-cum-channeler-of-my-dad's-spirit) that I imagined that cleaning up one side of the bridge would take 15 minutes. Grab and go, right? Shouldn't take that long. Well, I was wrong. It took much longer. While squatting to pick up trash, I found that trash often buried more trash. The layers multiplied the time it took to clean up one spot. Plus, some papers were stuck to the grooves of the gravel of the sidewalk, having sat there for so long. These required me to peel them off carefully. As for foam scraps that have a million tiny bubbles barely held together, I had to be careful not to break it up into smaller chunks that would further pollute the environment. Some of the trash was behind a fence, so I could not reach it and only dealt with the piles on the sidewalk side of the fence.
</p>

<p>
Soon I got tired. Shifting around and taking steps while squatting took more energy than I thought. I often found myself in dramatically downswooped positions in order to maintain balance while also being able to reach scraps I otherwise would not be able to reach had I not shifted into those positions. The physicality of the task was quite high and I was glad I had been stretching often and had good balance, in order to be physically fit enough for the task. I wondered whether potential helpers would find it too difficult to pick up trash for a long time. Where would they rest in between squats? I suppose they would have to stand up unless someone brought a lawn chair or stool to rest on.
</p>

<p>
There was a lot of broken glass and some dog poop. I picked up some glass pieces carefully but left the dog poop alone. At some point I realized I could not finish the entire bridge, not even one side of it. I had to prioritize the trash that I was picking up. I decided to get the biggest, most obvious pieces, and also anything made of plastic, and also glass shards in the middle of the sidewalk where people could easily step on them. I also thought about trying to rid the little patches of plants of any trash entangled inside. I followed my instinct as to what to pick up. Regardless, I couldn't do it all. This was only a start.
</p>

<p>
I wondered how to prevent littering. In the autonomous region of Rojava in northeastern Syria, the community is organized into multiple committees corresponding to aspects of the community that need collaborative work. Every family participates in the committees, the scope of which extend to a large group of families, known collectively as a commune, inhabiting the same geographic area. For example, there are economic, health, and defense committees. These came out of grassroots efforts to collaborate with neighbors. At the beginning, few were on board, but due to the collective perceived threat of Turkish invasion at one point, or so I heard, the community came together quickly afterwards. I imagined that it would take a lot of effort to organize such a system here in the United States, where there is little threat of invasion. Surely the earth sees littering as a threat to health, but we have become so spiritually distant from the earth in the big city that few seem to care. Perhaps those who do care are so boggled down with work and family obligations, such as taking care of children and elders, that they have no time to contribute. Even if one had time, it might deter them from cleaning up because of concerns about safety in the big city. Regardless, the issue is present and significant, and I cannot tolerate any spirit of defeatism. Even if organizing the neighborhood into a community where everyone is conscious of everyone else and wishes to help each other takes a long time, I cannot delay beginning this endeavor. In fact, the first steps are certainly "small" ones that naturally happen. The mere <i>visibility</i> I gain by being in public cleaning up trash may inspire some to join the cause or at least <i>think</i> about the problem of littering. Additionally, some neighbors might stop by and say hi. Ideally I would have a group of people where a specific person is tasked with engaging the neighbors to invite help and to create connections, but I was just on my own and somewhat shy, so few people stopped to greet me.
</p>

<p>
Few are still a few though! Dexter came, and so did our housemate Nebahat, who was riding with him. I saw my roommate Greg too, but he was walking to the subway station to go to work so could not stay and talk. Dexter asked me about my progress, and Nebahat expressed her admiration. Dexter said he was proud of me for doing this. He and Nebahat took some pictures and videos. I decided to use this as an opportunity to share the project on the internet via video, so I spoke a few words about the condition of the walkway and what I was doing.
</p>

<p>
Another person who came was a woman named Dulce! She was walking her dog somewhere, and she stopped by and said hi. She told me she wanted to help me. I asked her for her availability, and we decided based on that to meet on Monday morning to clean up the other side of the bridge. I was somewhat disillusioned by the apparent lack of care of the neighbors who walked by without saying anything, who were many, but indeed I was not making eye contact most of the time, and these people generally had places to be.
</p>

<p>
Eventually most of the north side of the bridge was cleaned up. There remains a pile among some plants, but I had no more space in my bags. Besides, eating only watermelon for breakfast was not a good idea. My legs were shaking, and I recognized this as a sign of low blood sugar. I threw the two full bags into a trash can that Dexter had pointed out to me, further down the street, and I went home. Upon entering my apartment, I saw my other housemate, J, whom I had thought was absent. She unexpected had some availability, so I invited her to join me and Dulce on Monday morning, and she agreed to come!
</p>

<p>
What would I do differently? I will bring more trash bags. I will eat a more substantial meal before coming. Otherwise, I'd do everything the same. Dexter spoke about bringing a broom to sweep the glass shards to the side, so I will consider this. It doesn't remove the litter, but it makes the shards a lesser safety risk. If I had more people I would find someone who could bring a chair to rest on, and I would task the most willing person with saying hi to the passersby and trying to engage them in collective action.
