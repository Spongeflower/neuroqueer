<h1>Clean up our world!</h1>
<h2>July 23, 2025</h2>
<p>
There is a sidewalk in my neighborhood on a highway overpass. It is littered with trash. Let's call the city and see what they do. If they are not complete in their cleanup, we will go there ourselves and rid the trash from the sidewalk. Hopefully this will discourage people from further dumping. As litter already present invites more litter, perhaps the lack of litter invites cleanliness. Every minute wasted theorizing represents the potential of a creature eating the trash.
