<h1>Â¡Neuroqueer Ministry!</h1>
<p>
  This website is a living museum of neuroqueer creativity. At the spiritual intersection of neurodivergence and queerness, we see the world in unique, underappreciated ways. Browse these pages and you shall glimpse into the collective neuroqueer consciousness. We hope you find inspiration, answers, <i>and</i> questions through exploring our projects, ideas, collections, and calls-to-action.
