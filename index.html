<h1>Â¡Neuroqueer Ministry!</h1>
<p>
  This website is a living museum of neuroqueer creativity. At the spiritual intersection of neurodivergence and queerness, we see the world in unique, underappreciated ways. Browse these pages and you shall glimpse into the collective neuroqueer consciousness. We hope you find inspiration, answers, <i>and</i> questions through exploring our projects, ideas, collections, and calls-to-action.

  Inquiries: We will make a new emailbox and provide his address here.

<h2>Question and Response</h2>
  <p><b>Q:</b> Is this an online community?</p>
  <p><b>R:</b> The editrix-cum-progenitrix intends not so, rather that this site <i>reflect</i> the neuroqueer realms. Realms, ay? Internal individual realms, internal collective realms, external individual, external collective ... If community is collective, then the surfer will find here the reflections of both internal and external collective neuroqueer realms, no? ... Meaning, collective thought, communal spiritbodies, and group ministry done in the world.</p>
  <p><b>Q:</b> Is there then an online community one can join, through this site? For example a server-o'-Discord?</p>
  <p><b>R:</b> Maybe. (<i>followed by a teacher's "I'll wait" face</i>) Consider that there might be tens of us who have our own such servers already. For example the editrix maintains one, with people she has recruited from various places, including the physical world, for the main purpose of connecting in the physical world. You are encouraged to foster physical community too. It's often better than online community, though the latter also has some advantages. Also consider our emailbox, whose address is written above.</p>
  <p><b>Q:</b> What sorts of group ministry are done?</p>
  <p><b>R:</b> What is good that we can do?</p>
  <p><b>Q:</b> Are non-neuroqueers welcome to contact you?</p>
  <p><b>R:</b> Yes, we have no reservations to engage with anybody who comes to us kind and curious. Do note that this site is nonetheless dedicated to the neuroqueer realms. Within ministry, for example, we might be joined by those known to be neurotypical or nonqueer or both. However, these folks would have joined us in ministry respecting and appreciating the neuroqueer <i>spirit</i> along with us.</p>
  <p><b>Q:</b> Why is this site called Neuroqueer Ministry? You speak of reflecting the neuroqueer "realms" yet the site is called ministry.</p>
  <p><b>R:</b> First, the honoring of neuroqueer realms is a form of ministry. This is the core purpose of the site. Second, the editrix wishes to emphasize and encourage the active nature of ministry. Ministry is doing good. <i>Doing</i>, not just thinking. These days so many peeps are hopeless. However, we still have agency and art. Nobody can take away our creative power, and nobody can stop us from inching forward toward our coflourishing with the Earth and our codwellers in her.</p>
