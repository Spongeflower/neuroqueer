<h2>Public Instrument, Private Player</h2>

I find it interesting the carillon, a set of at least 23 cast bronze bells played using an organlike console of wooden batons and pedals connected to the clappers of the bells, often mounted in towers of churches, universities, and town halls, is so public an instrument, its bright ringing sound washing over the city, when its player is so elusive! Who plays this instrument? Groundlings often think the carillon is always automated, but while there are such bell towers, the carillon is indeed rung by a fleshly human, whose identity is a mystery to the public since she is castled inside a small room at the top of the tower, separated from the masses by both distance and musical privilege.

I had a chance to learn carillon in undergrad. I had the privilege of knowing how to play the piano, my childhood lessons being one of the greatest gifts from my parents. As such, I had an upper hand in the audition process to enter the Guild of Student Carillonneurs. The guild at the time was super small and had been run by students after the last professional carillonneur hired by the school died. The students did not promote their little club, so among the 50,000 students it was usually assumed that the instrument was automated. I only found out about the existence of the human guild when out of my exploratory spirit, I stumbled into the carillon practice room one day and was subsequently caught by a guild member coming in to practice. I asked for forgiveness and a way to stay in touch so that I could audition. I got in easily, and after one year, the former director graduated, and since the club was so small, two out of the three of us became in charge of running the club. Justin became known as the administrative director, and I sunk into my role as the musical director. As the musical director I ran auditions, responded to local media, and later started a campaign to increase public involvement in carillon music. This culminated in the Carillon Project. Through the website, linked above, and my other efforts to reach composers, I opened up the repertoire of my school's carillon and other carillons to accept submissions of new compositions and arrangements. Before I graduated, I had recorded two new carillon pieces from first-time carillon composers who had never played the instrument themselves.

Very little progress has been made since I graduated, but today, January 7, 2026, I saw a new member join the Discord server I made as part of the project. I decided to revive the project and updated a few things in the website this morning. If any of you want guidance on composing for carillon, even as someone who has never composed anything musical before, let me know! On the home page of this website we have an email address you can write to, and on the Carillon Project website you can use the contact form to solicit advice as well. (It goes to my other email.) There certainly can be more done to encourage carillon composition and further lower the barrier of musical elitism, which has dominated carillon culture for centuries, but this is a start. So many non-composers or non-carillonneurs have a musical spirit within them, and I hope you will be able to unleash this spirit in one of the most public ways! Of course, all things public start private. For a new composer, that means reaching out to me personally, and for myself, that means putting in the work to connect with the carillon community and opening their minds to the idea of performing new music from non-carillonneurs.
