<h1>Villagebuilding</h1>
<h2>Editrix's Vision</h2>
<p>Call it intentional community, a commune, landdyking, a utopian project, a village, whatever. I just want it to be a good home, one where people connect with the earth and all her life, and with each other—an abode of peace, among nature. Among neuroqueers I have met many who wish to live in such a place. If we realize that our collective desire to build villages is a movement, then we may pool together our abilities, resources, intellect, and art and help us all realize this dream. In today's world, you need a lot of money and free time to build villages. I wish it weren't so, but in accepting the reality we better prepare ourselves to win a rigged game. Even if we all die, the game is not lost. Neuroqueers are forever. Our future generations will continue our ministry.</p>
<p>In striving toward a comfortable home, will we agree not to exploit each other, as has been normalized in the world? Are our moneyhavers and estateowners willing to be philanthropists?</p>
<h2>On Hosts and Guests</h2>
<p>As a guest one exists in a state outside of time, some might say. Indeed, there is something special about the occasion of staying in a home that is not your own. Some might even say the arrangement of being hosts and guests is liminal. A liminal space! This term refers to a transitional space, and certainly your host's house might be considered transitional since in the back of your mind you know you will eventually leave. However, I personally don't sense the liminality of being hosted much at all. Rather, as I write this from my friend's couch, I feel grounded. The fan flaps the right sleeve of my dress, and the flowers in their vases are blooming bright. Jazz plays in the background. Why can't I consider this my home if it feels so much like a home? Sure, I must leave, but I regularly leave the apartment that is considered actually mine too.</p>
<p>Imagine if we all believed this way: that Earth is our home, and that when we say a home is "mine" or "yours," we really mean most of the time that because you have designated yourself the responsibility of tending to the physical abode, for example on the basis that you are its main inhabitant, it is reasonable that you then get to make decisions about how to keep the abode. Why then must your home strictly <i>belong</i> to you? Even if you are a homeowner, you will eventually die and Earth will prove herself your ultimate home. I see, then, the concept of homeownership as a heuristic, meaning it is a pragmatic but sweeping way we convey our associaion with home. In the legal sense, for example, the conditions of your deed are multiple—homeownership is clearly not one single legal property. In another sense, of the tenant who says "this is my home," once again he is granted some rights and not others by the conditions of the lease. He can cook but he can't paint the walls. Could you then say the home is not his, for if it really were his, he must be allowed to exercise his agency to paint the walls, which are such a fundamental part of the house?</p>
<p>Ultimately you will rest in Earth. During your lives, a home of yours is considered <i>yours</i> on an associative and pragmatic basis, which, if you indeed see it this way, is easy to extent to guests. If you invited a guest, wouldn't your abode be a home to the guest insofar as a shelter is a home? And if the guest felt comfortable and free to be herself in this space, wouldn't you expect her to feel a real sense of home too?</p>
<p>Even before building up villages, we can delight in some of the benefits of living with cool peeps by being hosts and guests. Could we build for us neuroqueers (and allies) a global network of those willing to host, and those who want to be guests? Couchsurfing is one such platform, but it is for a general population. Still I have had many beautiful experiences hosting and being hosted through it, and I have made many nourishing connections.</p>
<p>What would be wonderful is a network of homes around the world that can host a group of people. The group makes the house a home, and the home makes the group a community. Good things will come of this. Surely, if we are doing this as an intermediate step towards achieving the building of a village in nature, then these homes might be considered transitional, hence liminal. Won't we be left wanting something more comfortable, closer to nature, and longer-term? We must remember now that our agency, directed both inwards and outwards, can make a huge difference. No matter how a space can be transitional or intermediate in nature, we can choose to <i>make</i> it a home.</p>
