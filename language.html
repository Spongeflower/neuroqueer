  Many neurodivergent people struggle with using language, yet many of us (including the same people) are adept at using language in some ways. Queer people may be conscious of language and words, as we find some descriptors and discourses unable to truly capture our nature, yet other applications of language can resonate with us in satisfying ways. That is to say ... neuroqueer peeps often have a special relationship with language. Many of us find it easier to express ourselves in writing than in the spoken word, and many of us feel the opposite. Sometimes both ways are simultaneously true, somehow. There is much art, invention, relation, and pain in the linguistic neuroqueer realms.
