<h2>Neuroqueers and Language</h2>
<p>
Many neurodivergent people struggle with using language, yet many of us (including the same people) are adept at using language in some ways. Queer people may be conscious of language and words, as we find some descriptors and discourses unable to truly capture our nature, yet other applications of language can resonate with us in satisfying ways. That is to say ... neuroqueer peeps often have a special relationship with language. Many of us find it easier to express ourselves in writing than in the spoken word, and many of us feel the opposite. Sometimes both ways are simultaneously true, somehow. There is much art, invention, relation, and pain in the linguistic neuroqueer realms.

<h2>Language Revitalization</h2>
<p>
My utopian spirit led to my childhood micronational project of Liubishuhuland, which along with my interest in languages made me a conlanger. (Conlang = constructed language.) Conlanging throughout my teens taught me linguistics. When I tried to find out more information about Cherokee one day during undergrad, around 2020 or 2021, at first simply captivated by the curly script, I found a lot of learning resources incomplete or otherwise inadequate. This bothered me, since I wanted to know the structure of Cherokee as closely as possible. This drive to know fueled a search for linguistic literature about the Cherokee language, which made me realize exactly what was missing from current learning resources. I figured I would fill in the gap by creating new resources, i.e. the resources I would have liked to see available in the first place, as a learner. Using the internet, I found some other people, mostly Cherokee, who already had projects to make better learning resources while they were also learning the language. This is how I got involved in language revitalization. When I entered this scene I felt that I had graduated from conlanging, in a way. (Later I would rediscover conlanging by seeing the benefit in focusing my interest in Chinese dialectlogy on the creation of a Chinese koine.)

<p>
Now I ask, does being neuroqueer shape my understanding of or my <i>doing</i> in the field of language revitalization? What does it mean to revitalize a language? What is the relationship between language and culture, or between language and an embodied mind? Inshallah we will live the answer.
