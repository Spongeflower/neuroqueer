<br>
<br>The times before the gyrocompass—tedious they were!
<br>Stand by MUG count, aye aye, sir!
<br>... because we're going on a field trip to the binnacle store.
<br>A deviated compass is such an eyesore!
<br>
<br>With corrector magnets and quadrantal spheres,
<br>binnacles lessen how much the ship interferes.
<br>You still must consult the deviation chart
<br>for binnacles shield compasses only in part!
<br>
<br>Binnies in the old days—their nails were made of iron,
<br>but these days ferrous metals we no longer be desirin'.
<br>If there is metal, it's likely nonmagnetic brass.
<br>We could have plastic too or even fiberglass.
<br>
<br>If ferrous metals interfere, a wise one recalls,
<br>then why did Lord Kelvin put iron in the balls?
<br>Symmetrically placed, they symmetricalize—
<br>that means, strengthen magnetic fields to about identical highs.
<br>
<br>From Latin habitāculum, meaning "little dwelling,"
<br>come "habitacle" and "binnacle," and when the sea is swelling,
<br>the gimbals keep the compass calm; indeed it's one good dwelling
<br>for canaries and vines, as Herman Melville was telling!
<br>
<br>Come down to the binnacle store, the pinnacle of reducing
<br>magnetic interference that the ship's hull is producing
<br>along with electrical equipment; that's why the flying bridge
<br>is your binnie's own binnie, where deviation's just a smidge!
<br>
<br>The times before the gyrocompass—tedious they were!
<br>Stand by MUG count, aye aye, sir!
<br>... because we're going on a field trip to the binnacle store.
<br>A deviated compass is such an eyesore!
<br>I say "binnacle"; you say "hooyah"!
<br>Binnacle! Hooyah! Binnacle! Hooyah!
