<br>
<br>The times before the gyrocompass—tedious they were!
<br>Stand by MUG count, aye aye, sir!
<br>... because we're going on a field trip to the binnacle store.
<br>A deviated compass is such an eyesore!
<br>
<br>With corrector magnets and quadrantal spheres,
<br>binnacles lessen how much the ship interferes.
<br>You still must consult the deviation chart
<br>for binnacles shield compasses only in part!
<br>
<br>Binnies in the old days—their nails were made of iron,
<br>but these days ferrous metals we no longer be desirin'.
<br>If there is metal, it's likely nonmagnetic brass.
<br>We even could have binnacles of plastic or fiberglass.
<br>
<br>From Latin habitāculum, meaning "little dwelling,"
<br>come "habitacle," "binnacle," and when the sea is swelling,
<br>the gimbal keeps the compass calm; indeed it's one good dwelling
<br>for canaries and vines, as Herman Melville was telling!
