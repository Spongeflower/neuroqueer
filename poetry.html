<b>Hop on!</b>
<br><i>Silence-Thunder</i>
<br>
<br>tapwater tea quenches
<br>four minutes, three seconds, two firsts and a thirst
<br>female progeny in infancy is burst
<br>or through the incumbency to be drawn,
<br>into cucumber ink is nursed
<br>by depictipotent rattus
<br>
<br>squoke the rate: depictipotent I am not!
<br>squake the cabbagecutter: at least you're drawable
<br>but why draw when hearable is her pendant scraping the chains
<br>of foretelling a prophet
<br>of loss over profit
<br>
<br>clearly in exploiting the silver ore
<br>the miners understood their boundaries were drawable
<br>or perhaps they overstood, fell into shafts,
<br>ate each other's spirits for supper
<br>and squoke: who's tougher?
<br>while their majors smelt the ore
<br>casted a silver oar
<br>paddled across the pond on a golden boat to eat honey-glazed cabbage
<br>fragrant with free radicals
<br>dusted with twenty-four-carat methamphetamorphosis
<br>
<br>squoke the miner: my cocoon is ready
<br>squake the major: I came from chrysalis, not cocoon
