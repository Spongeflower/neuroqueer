<br>You approach your best friend to hug him
<br>He calls you a name and your vision becomes fast
<br>You notice you’re on the floor and you had a concussion
<br>You have bruises all over your head
<br>You spend weeks and months with your jaw dislocated
<br>Your emotional state is weary from what happened
<br>You don’t have a home to return to
<br>You take a train 7 hours south
<br>You meet someone in the elevator
<br>He offers you his pipe
<br>You inhale to take away the pain
<br>He paints your lips white
<br>You spend a year away from school
<br>You leave your tent to go on long walks hours away from town
<br>You’re trying to find your parents, but have had no form of contact since your phone was stolen
<br>You are approached by someone on a bicycle, who says, “it’s okay.”
<br>You live in a dark room for 2 or 3 months
<br>You wake up one morning seeing a clear needle and don’t remember the previous day or your name
<br>You leave this person
<br>You still don’t have a phone and decide it’s time to find one
<br>Look for RV parks
<br>Look on the outside of the RV, near the storage on the back
<br>Find a phone and a bicycle
<br>Contact everyone you can on social media asking for help
<br>Obtain a bus ticket to where you grew up
<br>Sneak into your parents garage

<b>I. GOOD MORNING</b>
<br><i>GreyNile and Silence-Thunder</i>
<br>
<br><b>G:</b> Tomorrow, the wind will dawn in me the light of a thousand kind words, for my heart has been broken and smashed to dust but retained its beauty.
<br><b>S:</b> I will rise in the morning with a heart of glitter. Wind seeps under my skin, refracting into a myriad eastern rays whispering good morning.
</p>

<b>II. CONCENTRIC HEARTS</b>
<br><i>GreyNile and Silence-Thunder</i>
<br>
<br><b>G:</b>
<br>hearts of hearts of hearts of hearts the expressions are wordless and beautiful
<br>words are ever present around the books in the buildings we crave to be inside of and outside of all the time
<br>we can't take it in or else we'd never be the same again because we can't understand the whole of heuristics and heirloom textbooks
<br>why take a piece if you can't hold the whole? it'll leave you feeling empty and without what you should have.
<br>"you should have been smarter. you should have worked harder. if you can't describe yourself in terms I'd understand, don't bother at all."
<br>dreary little attics call you forward to receive you. blow off the dust from what you once knew so well. retrieve the debris of your disastrous past mistakes.
<br>drifting memories leave wakes in unfamilar coves. you hold onto your visions of landmarks and beloved friends.
<br>you create a sturdy ship to keep up with the waves. be careful not to capsize when the comets arrive.
<br><b>S:</b>
<br>CONCENTRIC HEARTS:
<br>under my skin a building
<br>in the building a book
<br>in the book words
<br>in the words me
<br>attic of antics, all these years dark. flicker flacker, today's flame, and doth the dust of yesterday's lotus of pulverized hearts reveal herself a gleaming pile of glitter.
<br>stardust snow, warm waves, my sloop slurring white wakes ...
<br>comets drift by like old memories ...
</p>

<b>III. UNINTENTIONALIZED</b>
<br><i>GreyNile and Silence-Thunder</i>
<br>
<br><b>G:</b> if someone unintentionally unintentionalized themselves, would anybody retain intentions for them in their stead, or would they remain intentionless?
<br><b>S:</b> the unintentionalizer becomes a worm
<br>after all, if they unintentionally unintentionalized, they were a worm to begin with
<br><b>G:</b> to be put on a hook and fished by someone with catchy intentions
<br><b>S:</b> to be let off a hook and tricked by a lemon with squirty aspirations
<br><b>G:</b> just don't aspirate the lemon juice as you and your parachute descend
<br><b>S:</b> nor intend the downfloat without anglers to befriend
</p>

<b>A Stodgy Zaibatsu Meet-Cute?</b>
<br><i>Silence-Thunder</i>
<br>
<br>we must probe the newarriver
<br>on hyphenation rather than
<br>scribipotent, audipotent ...
<br>now will the wealthclique
<br>become the good guys and eat themselves?
<br>rich fish, fatty like salmon
<br>and ¡oh ho ho! even if they proclaim:
<br>well, money is just debt, and
<br>we are for global debt forgiveness,
<br> will we still open up a boy with the cold ones
<br>and drink said boy? said Boy.
<br>now there were five girls:
<br>Grace, Faith, Hope, Jessica, and Retribution,
<br>the drive toward whom heated plates upon crates
<br>of hot compliance over complaint
<br>inundipotence over floodability
<br>
<br>who now swims these synapses? huh?
<br>show yourself, you transients!
<br>and transitivize my rivering
</p>

<b>Hop on!</b>
<br><i>Silence-Thunder</i>
<br>
<br>tapwater tea quenches
<br>four minutes, three seconds, two firsts and a thirst
<br>female progeny in infancy is burst
<br>or through the incumbency to be drawn,
<br>into cucumber ink is nursed
<br>by depictipotent rattus
<br>
<br>squoke the rate: depictipotent I am not!
<br>squake the cabbagecutter: at least you're drawable
<br>but why draw when hearable is her pendant scraping the chains
<br>of foretelling a prophet
<br>of loss over profit
<br>
<br>clearly in exploiting the silver ore
<br>the miners understood their boundaries were drawable
<br>or perhaps they overstood, fell into shafts,
<br>ate each other's spirits for supper
<br>and squoke: who's tougher?
<br>while their majors smelt the ore
<br>casted a silver oar
<br>paddled across the pond on a golden boat to eat honey-glazed cabbage
<br>fragrant with free radicals
<br>dusted with twenty-four-carat methamphetamorphosis
<br>
<br>squoke the miner: my cocoon is ready
<br>squake the major: I came from chrysalis, not cocoon
