<br>You approach your best friend to hug him
<br>He calls you a name and your vision becomes fast
<br>You notice you’re on the floor and you had a concussion
<br>You have bruises all over your head
<br>You spend weeks and months with your jaw dislocated
<br>Your emotional state is weary from what happened
<br>You don’t have a home to return to
<br>You take a train 7 hours south
<br>You meet someone in the elevator
<br>He offers you his pipe
<br>You inhale to take away the pain
<br>He paints your lips white
<br>You spend a year away from school
<br>You leave your tent to go on long walks hours away from town
<br>You’re trying to find your parents, but have had no form of contact since your phone was stolen
<br>You are approached by someone on a bicycle, who says, “it’s okay.”
<br>You live in a dark room for 2 or 3 months
<br>You wake up one morning seeing a clear needle and don’t remember the previous day or your name
<br>You leave this person
<br>You still don’t have a phone and decide it’s time to find one
<br>Look for RV parks
<br>Look on the outside of the RV, near the storage on the back
<br>Find a phone and a bicycle
<br>Contact everyone you can on social media asking for help
<br>Obtain a bus ticket to where you grew up
<br>Sneak into your parents garage

<br>we must probe the newarriver
<br>on hyphenation rather than
<br>scribipotent, audipotent ...
<br>now will the wealthclique
<br>become the good guys and eat themselves?
<br>rich fish, fatty like salmon
<br>and ¡oh ho ho! even if they proclaim:
<br>well, money is just debt, and
<br>we are for global debt forgiveness,
<br> will we still open up a boy with the cold ones
<br>and drink said boy? said Boy.
<br>now there were five girls:
<br>Grace, Faith, Hope, Jessica, and Retribution,
<br>the drive toward whom heated plates upon crates
<br>of hot compliance over complaint
<br>inundipotence over floodability
<br>
<br>who now swims these synapses? huh?
<br>show yourself, you transients!
<br>and transitivize my rivering

<br>
<br>tapwater tea quenches
<br>four minutes, three seconds, two firsts and a thirst
<br>female progeny in infancy is burst
<br>or through the incumbency to be drawn,
<br>into cucumber ink is nursed
<br>by depictipotent rattus
<br>
<br>squoke the rate: depictipotent I am not!
<br>squake the cabbagecutter: at least you're drawable
<br>but why draw when hearable is her pendant scraping the chains
<br>of foretelling a prophet
<br>of loss over profit
<br>
<br>clearly in exploiting the silver ore
<br>the miners understood their boundaries were drawable
<br>or perhaps they overstood, fell into shafts,
<br>ate each other's spirits for supper
<br>and squoke: who's tougher?
<br>while their majors smelt the ore
<br>casted a silver oar
<br>paddled across the pond on a golden boat to eat honey-glazed cabbage
<br>fragrant with free radicals
<br>dusted with twenty-four-carat methamphetamorphosis
<br>
<br>squoke the miner: my cocoon is ready
<br>squake the major: I came from chrysalis, not cocoon
