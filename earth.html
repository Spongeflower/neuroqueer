<h2>No one is illegal on stolen land: a conversation on hypocrisy and hope</h2>
<p><i>condensed from a three-way call in the United States on July 18, 2025</i></p>
<p><b>G:</b> No one is illegal on stolen land!
  <br><b>M:</b> No one should be illegal in general, I would say. Also, "stolen land" is a term I take issue with, for it implies the recourse is apology or undoing the stealing, but the former is not enough and the latter is not feasible. For example, a white American schoolchild today is not a literal colonizer. Even if they have a colonizer's mindset, emphasizing that land was stolen might prevent today's folk from believing in the more useful course of action of encouraging everyone to tend to the land they live on. So I am curious as to what your point is.
  <br><b>G:</b> What I mean is this. When the colonizers arrived in America, the Native Americans resisted the expansion of the American empire, which was carried out through the nonconsensual taking of their land, the brutal killing and removal of their people, and the erasure of their culture. Sure, maybe some Native Americans had no concept of private property, and thus the colonizer could argue, "well, if you have no concept of land ownership, then you cannot legally prevent us from settling in the land you inhabit." Now the United States, having been founded by immigrants, is declaring some immigrants illegal. The government is hypocritical and wrong for this, to have their cake and eat it too.
  <br><b>M:</b> I doubt that all indigenous Americans had no concept of property ownership though. I think some tribes had such a concept, or similar ones. Me personally, I am generally against the idea of property ownership, and I would rather people see it as stewardshipâ€”caring for the land.
  <br><b>S:</b> Imagine ... if nobody was considered to have really <i>owned</i> the land in the first place then how can it be stolen? Think about it, and you will see one issue with the term "stolen" ... perhaps just "colonized" is a more accurate term.
  <br><b>M:</b> My issue with the term "stolen" is a different one though. I am actually okay with people using the term, and in a sense I support it. After all, we should remember and learn from the past, and mourn. However, we must <i>act</i> and care for the earth in tangible ways rather than just talking theory and letting past wrongs bind us to inaction.
  <br><b>G:</b> Well, they did steal the <i>people</i> off of the land. Indigenous culture was also erased. That comes pretty close to stealing. Even if some or all Native Americans had no concept of land ownership, the effect of colonization is still very tangible and negative. What we personally think of land ownership is really just a tangent, for my thesis is that insofar as the United States claims the supposed precolonial lack of belief in land ownership as a green flag for subjugating the indigenous people, they are now hypocritical in asserting their iron rule over the influx of later waves of immigrants.
  <br><b>M:</b> I see what you are saying. And certainly regardless of the hypocrisy, the acts committed against the native peoples are in themselves heinous. Also, I don't think the native cultures are fully erased. The indigenous cultures still exist but can be hard to see if you don't pay attention. The state of cultural transmission is certainly very concerning in some areas like language due to government boarding schools, but it is precisely in these vulnerable areas that revitalization efforts are taking place. Unfortunately some languages I believe will go dormant, meaning their last speakers will die, but even then there is no giving up, as the amassed research on those languages can still possibly revive them. What I mean is, all of this is a very depressing topic, but we must not lose our sense of agency to keep cultures alive and restore and care for our natural environment the best we can.
  <br><b>G:</b> Indeed, I see. I think about today's immigration situation. How would Native Americans feel about this? Some might say, "You are deporting any immigrant deemed to be illegally present, not just the very few actually bad people. If you call yourself a just country, and you claimed the agency to invade my land centuries ago, as actual criminals, why can't our newer immigrants, who are here mostly to escape the atrocities and poverty of their homelands, also claim agency to settle here and to resist your forcing them out? You are <i>hypocritical</i> to slaughter your way in and deny entry to newcomers, especially the peaceful ones of today." All this I mean to encapsulate in my original point.
