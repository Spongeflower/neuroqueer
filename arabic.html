While the Islamic lens is a nourishing perspective, there is nonetheless great wonder in the Arabic language from a secular lens, particularly one rooted in the appreciation of linguistics. In terms of linguistic typology, Arabic stands out in being the most spoken language dispalying nonconcatenative morphology. Among the Semitic languages Arabic displays a mixture of traits that makes it hard to determine its "genetic" relationship to the other Semitic languages, which include Aramaic, Hebrew, and Amharic, among others. The main theories about the development of Arabic as a Semitic language even challenge the very usefulness of the family tree paradigm of language classification, which is so accepted in Indo-European linguistics that it may be convincing to generalize this model to all other language families. The state of the use of Arabic is essentially diglossia, where native speakers learn their local dialect and then study Modern Standard Arabic in school, which has a high status in Arabic society due to its similarity (approaching equivalence in ways) to the Classical Arabic of the Qur'ān.

Arabic is among the first interests of the editrix, stemming back to age 9 or so. The script is beautiful and the cultures are rich. Arabic poetry in particular is a very old and respected tradition going back to pre-Islamic times (the Jāhiliyyah).
