<h2>The Drum Circle</h2>
<p>
When you walk into Manhattan's Central Park from the east, first you are greeted by the heartfelt melodies of a jazz trumpeter busking in the middle of a bubble in the walkway, and then you see a lawn speckled with groups of friends on blankets. Walk further and you hear the rustling of the trees and the dinging of a river of bicyclists. At sunset in the summer, twinkling fireflies blanket the grass. Soon, you hear a gallop in the distance, a rhythm rolling on and on. The beat gets louder, and you feel the vibrations booming on your skin just as the path leads you into a promenade lined on either side with great American elms, their branches laden with green vaulting high overhead. The mirroring rows of benches stretch as far as the eye can see to the south, and to the north they suddenly stop at a clearing, a plaza where tourists and fruit vendors abound, spritely skaters whizzing between them. Right before the clearing, at the edge of the elms, behold: a group of drummers, old and young, sitting on the benches banging on djembes between their knees, surrounding one stout dark-skinned man in shades and a headcloth, striking the heads of three barrels of drums laid out in front of him. Amid the drummers is also a bell player, dinging an agile but constant pattern. This is the beating heart of New York City, and the dancers know it to their bones! The crowd is swayed and rocked to dance all afternoon, whether slow and soulful, or frenetic and feverish, or more often, somewhere in between. Here, West African rhythms and dances are peppered with rumba sensibilities, and the little Thai boy improvizing hip-hop moves at the circle's center is being filmed by Turkish aunties.

Ah, the drum circle. How did this come about? And how does it move with the world, and within itself?

I found out about drum circles through homeless young adults back in my undergraduate years. They were the clients at a resource center I volunteered in. Anyone who associates with homeless youth will notice the affinity some have towards the djembe, a West African goblet-shaped wooden hand drum, its head made of the hide of a goat or a cow. Certainly in the US this affinity is obvious, at least in the area I resided in. After all, the drummers among them often carry the drums on their backs. One day a client told me about a drum circle he regularly went to, so I decided to check it out.

I showed up one Sunday afternoon under a big lone pecan tree on a lawn of grass. In the shade of the tree, the grass made way for the bare earth. There, on the bare earth, were several adults, mainly women who were dressed in a way that would cause them to be recognized as hippies. Their dance was free in form, not adhering to any rigid tradition I knew of. Some speak of this dance as "ecstatic." Around them, and the tree, were the drummers—an entire circle of them, seated in their own lawnchairs and benches, playing djembe and other drums, notably congas and bongó. Inward from the main circle were the stations of the dundun players, often two of them. These were typically stocky men with proven stamina. Their drums were each a set of three—low, middle, and high in pitch. They grasped a wooden stick in each hand and led the entire group by starting and finishing each set, each with its own rhythmic base, which they would play on repeat, sometimes for half an hour at a time. Often they would change the pattern and emphasize a short, sudden, and loud pattern to signal the end of the set, which would sometimes flow into the next pattern and sometimes make way for a short period of quiet. Among the circle were not just drummers, but spectators, and numerous children. Most of the attendees were White Americans, slightly more ethnically monolithic than the city itself, which was more diverse in this regard. Among the drummers, dancers, and spectators were a significant number of homeless youth. As for the adults in general, they varied in age. The old had gray hair, and the young seemed to typically start in the 30s, except for the homeless youth, who were younger. Nearly none were obviously current college students, despite the large student popultion of this city.

If you stayed into the evening, the light twirlers would show up. They spun batons with colorful lights on their ends. Some of them may have also been juggling during the daytime hours. Someone told me the fun would last far into the night, and sometimes they would build a fire. I never stayed that long.
