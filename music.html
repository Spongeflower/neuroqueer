<h2>The Drum Circle</h2>
<p>
When you walk into Manhattan's Central Park from the east, first you are greeted by the heartfelt melodies of a jazz trumpeter busking in the middle of a bubble in the walkway, and then you see a lawn speckled with groups of friends on blankets. Walk further and you hear the rustling of the trees and the dinging of a river of bicyclists. At sunset in the summer, twinkling fireflies blanket the grass. Soon, you hear a gallop in the distance, a rhythm rolling on and on. The beat gets louder, and you feel the vibrations booming on your skin just as the path leads you into a promenade lined on either side with great American elms, their branches laden with green vaulting high overhead. The mirroring rows of benches stretch as far as the eye can see to the south, and to the north they suddenly stop at a clearing, a plaza where tourists and fruit vendors abound, spritely skaters whizzing between them. Right before the clearing, at the edge of the elms, behold: a group of drummers, old and young, sitting on the benches banging on djembes between their knees, surrounding one stout dark-skinned man in shades and a headcloth, striking the heads of three barrels of drums laid out in front of him. Amid the drummers is also a bell player, dinging an agile but constant pattern. This is the beating heart of New York City, and the dancers know it to their bones! The crowd is swayed and rocked to dance all afternoon, whether slow and soulful, or frenetic and feverish, or more often, somewhere in between. Here, West African rhythms and dances are peppered with rumba sensibilities, and the little Thai boy improvizing hip-hop moves at the circle's center is being filmed by Turkish aunties.

Ah, the drum circle. How did this come about? And how does it move with the world, and within itself?
